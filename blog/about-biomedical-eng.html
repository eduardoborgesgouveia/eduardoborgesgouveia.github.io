          <p>
            A biomedical engineer is trained in the application of engineering principles and design concepts to the field of medicine and biology. This often involves the development of medical devices and technologies that improve patient diagnosis, treatment, and care.
          </p>
          <p>
            One potential area where a biomedical engineer could make significant contributions is in the field of neuromorphic engineering. This is a rapidly growing field that focuses on the development of artificial systems that mimic the functions of the human nervous system.
          </p>
          <p>
            Neuromorphic systems are typically designed to be highly efficient and adaptive, making them well-suited for applications in areas such as robotics, signal processing, and neural prosthetics. By working with neuroscientists and other experts in the field, a biomedical engineer could help to design and develop new technologies that better understand and replicate the workings of the human brain.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to advancing scientific knowledge, this work could also have significant industrial applications. For example, neuromorphic systems could be used to improve the performance of robots and other intelligent machines, leading to more efficient and effective manufacturing processes.
          </p>
          <p>
            For that reason, I have been involved with neuromorphic engineering since my graduation when I used a R-CNN to classify and identify objects recorded by an event-based camera (<a class="text-link" href="https://repositorio.ufu.br/handle/123456789/25942" target="_blank">Object identification using Neuromorphic vision and convolutional neural networks</a>). After that I get more involved in the world of neuromorphic vision getting my masterâ€™s in sciences (MSc) degree, when I start to apply the process of identification of objects recorded by event-based cameras to robotics systems developing a <a class="text-link" href="https://repositorio.ufu.br/handle/123456789/34247" target="_blank">Reach Strategy for Upper Limb Prostheses Based on Neuromorphic Vision </a>. During my time in the academic world I:
          </p>
				    <ul class="mb-5">
					  <li class="mb-2">Worked with event-based cameras, upper limb prosthetic arm control, and object detection
              using deep learning</li>
					  <li class="mb-2">Was a assistant lecturer in the Introduction to Computer Technology class</li>
					  <li class="mb-2">I participated in the organization of 7 scientific events (national conferences and regional conferences)</li>
					  <li class="mb-2">I had 18 published papers in conferences</li>
					  <li class="mb-2">At the time I'm writting this, i have 1 paper under review on IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics</li>
            
					</ul>
          <p>
            However, getting back, I think that the development of advanced neural prosthetics could have a profound impact on the lives of individuals with neurodegenerative diseases or injuries to the central nervous system. By collaborating with other experts in the field, a biomedical engineer could help to develop technologies that restore function and improve quality of life for these individuals.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, the intersection of biomedical engineering and neuromorphic engineering presents a rich area of research and development that has the potential to advance both scientific knowledge and industrial innovation. By working in this field, a biomedical engineer could make significant contributions to our understanding of biological systems and help to develop technologies that improve the lives of people around the world.
